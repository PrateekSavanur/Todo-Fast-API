# pipenv
# According to pypa/pipenv#598, it is recommended to include Pipfile.lock in version control.
# However, in case of collaboration, if having platform-specific dependencies or dependencies
# having no cross-platform support, pipenv may install dependencies that don't work, or not
# install all needed dependencies.
Pipfile.lock

# poetry
# Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to include poetry.lock in version control.
# However, in specific cases (e.g., when dealing with platform-specific dependencies), you may
# consider not including it.
